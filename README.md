# Simple-LLM-App
Here is a simple streamlit app that has Microsoft's Phi-3.5-mini-instruct LLM incorporated in it.

## Motivation
This was my first hands-on experience with an LLM and getting familar with integrating a Hugging Face API into an app.

## Dependencies
* LLM integration: Hugging Face
* Deployment: Streamlit

## Plans
I was thinking about where I would like to go with this project.

There are just so many things to learn and so many cool projects to do, so I've decided that my next step with this project will be to fine tune this model. Learn some RAG and make it focused on answering questions for CS majors such as myself who wish to learn more about LLMs but are paralysed by the sheer number of cool technologies that need to be learned haha.
